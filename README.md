# chrome-remote-interface-haskell

A client to interact with Chrome remotely.

## Motivation

The mainstream option to do that is [chrome-remote-interface](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface) which is a NodeJS lib.

I struggle a bit to find informations about what I would get from methods. Also, as a matter of personal preference, I find the Promise syntax a bit verbose.

So why not use Haskell.
